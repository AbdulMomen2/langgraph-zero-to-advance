# 🧠 LangGraph Zero to Advanced — LLM Agent Development Journey

This repository showcases my complete learning journey of **LangGraph**, from beginner to advanced, where I explored how to build and orchestrate **LLM-based agents**, **multi-agent systems**, and **intelligent chatbots** capable of reasoning, tool use, and collaboration.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Throughout this repo, I learned how to:

- Build **autonomous agents** powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Design **agent workflows** using LangGraph’s node-based architecture
- Enable **multi-agent collaboration** (Planner, Coder, Reviewer, Researcher)
- Integrate **tools and APIs** for task execution
- Develop **chatbots** with persistent memory and dynamic reasoning

---

## 🧩 Highlights

- 🧠 **LLM-Powered Agents** — Each agent is built on top of an LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models)
- 🔗 **LangGraph Workflow Design** — Structured multi-agent systems via directed graphs
- 🤖 **Chatbots with Context & Memory** — Agents that can hold context and adapt their tone
- 🧮 **Tool-Using Agents** — Agents that can call APIs, search the web, or write code dynamically
- ⚡ **Advanced Graphs** — Conditional routing, parallel reasoning, and self-correcting loops
- 🗂️ **Modular Design** — Each folder represents a step in the learning path from zero to advanced

## 📚 Learning Stages

### 1️⃣ Beginner — Foundations

- Understanding LangGraph structure (nodes, edges, states)
- Building simple reasoning agents
- Passing messages between nodes

### 2️⃣ Intermediate — Multi-Agent Workflows

- Creating multiple agents (Planner → Executor → Evaluator)
- Shared state and memory management
- Dynamic decision-making in graphs

### 3️⃣ Advanced — Autonomous Systems

- Multi-agent collaboration with reasoning loops
- Tool integration (search, Python REPL, API calls)
- Error handling, retries, and adaptive routing
- Full chatbot systems with backend APIs
